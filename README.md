Title: The Inside Scoop on Songwriting for Film & TV!
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 11, 2011
Review: I just finished reading Robin Frederick's new book and I am very impressed. It took me a long time to read it because I had to stop and think about the depth of information being supplied. She has captured in 319 wonderful pages, so many, if not all, of the questions that I had as a singer/songwriter trying to enter the film and TV markets. The book is well organized, methodical, written in an easy to read style, and it is extremely informative. The exercises called "Do it Now" will be things I can work on for the next few years. She has performed detailed research and interviewed major film & TV players and has thoroughly explained the essence of this part of the music industry market. Naturally she encourages us as songwriters and composers to aim for "excellence" in our songwriting craft and to be exceptional in our personal involvement with this fascinating hot growing market .

Thanks to her brilliant efforts, the outlook is bright for those who are willing to do the work and grow and develop the necessary elements in their music required to achieve success. Now where is that "button ending" she talks about? Oh yes, here it is.

Review: I've been writing songs for a long time, blindly. This book has helped me out tremendously in identifying the tools that I should've known all along for a song that listeners want to hear again & again! Especially when I'm stuck now in my writing, I just turn to the proper section of this book for some A+ solutions that will work for film & TV!

Review: This book really is one of a kind. I have found nothing else dealing in depth with music film and tv from a writers perspective. The organization of the book is great, every chapter is descriptive and precise about the content, and that makes it really useful as an encyclopedia type of book that you can pull off the shelf when you are dealing with particular issues of the creative process. It's a MUST HAVE book for the modern "do it yourself" writer and artist as I see it. Robin Frederick disseminates the matters really well in a highly engaging and motivating style. It's easy to read, and useful for a long, long time ahead. If you are interested in songwriting and producing music for film and tv, this book will not dissapoint you.

Title: Robin Does It Again
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 20, 2012
Review: I don't know why it took me so long to buy and then read Robin Frederick's second book. Her first one was so comprehensive, I guess I figured she would just mix the information up a different way--not so. She presents material that is fresh, new, relevant and valuable to the specific craft of writing songs for TV and Film--in just the way she advises people to mindfully write their songs. She knows what she is talking about, and she knows just enough about every aspect of writing songs: melody, lyrics, chord structure, music theory, arrangement, vocal technique, computer technology, recording technique, to provide a useful "how to" book without intimidating anyone. Buy it. Read it. Don't take as long as I did to do so. But only if you want to know how to successfully write songs for the film and television market.

Review: Robin's book was recommended to me by a SongU alumni and all I can say is thank you so much for writing this book Robin !!!! It is truly one of the best songwriting books I have EVER purchased.( And I have quite a few). It is real easy to read and organized in a great way with the shortcuts cross-referenced in each chapter. Lots of great examples in links to artists songs to give you a real leg up in your learning about the genre. Fantastic for writers wanting to break into the film and tv market. I submitted a song to several pitches this past week and got a nibble already from a library in LA ! I hope it converts to a placement ! Thanks again Ms Frederick !!! Well done !!!

Title: Must Buy!
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 1, 2012
Review: If you are even remotely interested in writing music for Film and/or Television you should definately purchase this book. Everything Robin has to say will open your eyes and give you a direction you need to follow to be successful. I never even really paid attention to the music that is used in film and television until I got this book, and it helped me to pay attention and realize how much the music adds and supports the scenes. I feel confident now that I can create the type of music that no one will really know is there.. yet not be able to get the scene/emotion out of their head because of it. BUY IT EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT PLANNING TO WRITE MUSIC FOR FILM AND/OR TV. It's a great read.
